In fact, you start out writing **terrible** code, and then, you learn how to do better. 

As a developer with a passion for mentoring and teaching others, I've decided to start this blog to share my journey and help others on theirs. Far from all the "Learn X in Y minutes" articles, this is where I share my successes, failures, and the valuable lessons I've learned along the way.

You can also see what I'm currently [working on](/work), and what I'm up to [right now](/now).
