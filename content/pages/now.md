This page goes on about what I'm *most probably* doing right now. Think of it as free stalking material...

## What I'm doing right now

Currently living between Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª.

I recently experienced a career change, as I was unfortunately made redundant in October 2022. Instead of jumping into another role right away, I took the opportunity to focus on my health and reevaluate my priorities. I wanted to take a step back and think about where I am now and where I want to be going forward.

During this time, I discovered a new passion for organising my thoughts and have been implementing the [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) method using Obsidian to build a more efficient "second brain". The changes I was able to apply so far have shown a significant increase in productivity and efficiency in my workflows, and they also improved how well I've been able to retain information in my studies. I also took the time to prioritize my physical health by creating a structured and consistent routine for nutrition and exercise, in order to maintain a better balance between my personal and professional life.

Now, with my priorities in order, I am excited to apply what I've learned to new opportunities and projects. I am also looking forward to giving talks and workshops again and sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.
