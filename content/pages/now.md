This page goes on about what I'm *most probably* doing right now. Think of it as free stalking material...

## What I'm doing right now

Brazilian ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· born and raised, living in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, and frequently visiting Belgium ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª.

Just moved from being a Data Scientist for over 5 years to being a DevOps Engineer. The DevOps field is something that caught my attention way back, in 2016, but as a then college grad student I was trying out different possible roles. Now I'm back to something I'm confident to say interests me the most from what I tried so far and that has been a lovely change!

But going back to working in a structured environment and having teammates has put me in a position to be able to drastically change how I used to deal with collaboration, learning, and handling feedback. I feel like I grew a lot in a short time and this new path I opened is something I'm looking very forward to experiencing.

Now, onto the more soft-skills area, I would advise anyone to look into a "second brain" approach to note-taking, with atomic and linked notes ([Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)), and to practice off-loading your brain for a fresh start of the day with some [morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/) (which I do daily). More than that, a consistent exercise and mobility routine, consistent sleep, and healthy nutrition will go a long way not only to make your body feel good, but your brain too.

## What I'm learning

- This personal one-page turned mini blog, resumÃ© and about page is a recent project into learning Golang, the Hugo framework and getting a refresh of some web technologies (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)
- Getting the hang of Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, Helm, and so on and so forth to grow in my new role

## What I'm reading (and if you're nosy, what [I've read](/read-in-2023) last year) 

### Non-fiction

- [The First 90 Days](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15824358-the-first-90-days) by Michael D. Watkins

### Fiction

- [An Echo of Things to Come](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32498052-an-echo-of-things-to-come) by James Islington
- [The Undetectables](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63840324-the-undetectables) by Courtney Smyth

## On a personal note

- Been working towards a healthier and kinder-to-myself lifestyle. Strongly recommend these apps: 
  - [Gentler Streak](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gentler-streak-health-fitness/id1576857102) to having a more self-compassionate approach to exercise
  - [Rise Sleep](https://web.risescience.com/sign-up?code=gift) to have a better understanding of your sleep and how to own your circadian cycle
  - [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/), the best journaling app out there
- Been working on my discipline and productivity toward better time management and work-life balance. Strongly recommend these apps:
  - [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), a MacOS spotlight on steroids that turned all my workflow completely keyboard-oriented. I basically don't use a mouse or trackpad anymore
  - [Superhuman](https://superhuman.com/refer/kg5sby9p), the best email client ever! Salty price, but the keyboard shortcuts are totally worth it for me. I could never empty my inbox and now I'm completely inbox zero.
  - [Rize](https://rize.io?code=4ABA4F&utm_source=refer&name=Izabela), it's a game changer time-keeper and time-management tool. I know exactly what I did with my day and it even helps me stay on track!
- Getting elbow-deep into the hobby of collecting fountain pens and inks
- Being a GM for a 2-year-long (and counting!) campaign of Curse of Strahd (D&D 5e), and sometimes a few one-shots... *please feel free to invite me to be a player for a change*
