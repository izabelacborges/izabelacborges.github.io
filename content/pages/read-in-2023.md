I found 4 new favourites this year, that I would recommend to anyone and everyone:

- Tress of the Emerald Sea
- Lonely Castle in the Mirror
- Babel
- The Adventures of Amina al-Sirafi

I also found two books that I would caution people and tell them to keep away (your life will be better without them, really):

- If Cats Disappeared from the World
- The Night Circus
