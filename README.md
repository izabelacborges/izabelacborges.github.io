New project to learn Golang, Hugo, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I'm putting a bit of time into this to learn some new things and to have a place to share my thoughts and experiences. I'll _try_ to keep it updated, but no promises.

Adapted from [this theme](https://github.com/zerostaticthemes/hugo-winston-theme) with a good amount of help from [this awesome guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I).
